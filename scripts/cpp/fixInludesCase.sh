USAGE:
${scriptName} [OPTION]... SRC_DIR

Fixes filename case include directives of source files found in SRC_DIR,
as necessary. It also fixes slashes ( \\ -> / ).

Details:
Script tries to find included file in include paths. (first relative to source
file's directory, then in specified include paths). First it tries
case-sensitive search in all paths. If that fails, it tries case-insensitive
search in all include paths (except for nofix paths). If it succeeds, it fixes
filename in include directory as necessary. If it fails, no change is done.
Slashes are fixed either way, if necessary ( \\ -> / ).

Limitations:
Script does not support include paths with spaces.
Script cannot fix case in include directive starting with ../ (parent dir),
except for fixing slashes.

OPTIONS:
-I [PATH]
--include-path [PATH]
    Include path, where to search included files. Also used to fix filename
    case as necessary, if possible. This argument can be specified
    more than once.

-N [PATH]
--include-paths-nofix [PATH]
    Similar include-path, but files here are not considered when trying to fix
    case (only in search, if file exists). This argument can be specified
    more than once.
